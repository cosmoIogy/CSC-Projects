Abstract Methods:
Methods that are intended to be implemented in subclasses of the abstract class
A way of promising the subclasses will implement functionality

Abstract CLasses:
Classes that are designed to never be instantiated
Serves as a template for sublass

Conrete Classes:
Classes that can be and are designed to be instantiated 

3 Ways To Implement:
    1. raise NotImplementedError
    2. (recommended) Use the ABC class (Abstract Base Class)
    3. Use ABCMeta (deprecated.. don't do this)
