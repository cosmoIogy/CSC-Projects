Abstraction - the ability to ignore the details of parts of a system in order to focus on a higher level

Ex : Google Maps and zooming in/out shows Abstraction

Ex: In programming, .append() on a list, typically when we use it we don't really carea out the details of implementation, 
    just that it adds to the end of our list
