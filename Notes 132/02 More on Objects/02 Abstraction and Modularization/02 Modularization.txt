Modularization
    The concept of dividing a whole into well defined parts that can each be examined separately.
    Makes maintaining code much easier.

Ex : When designing a vehicle class, you may end up splitting it into other classes like:
    Car, Truck, Bike, and HotAirBalloon, and Airplane, and PiggyBackFriend can be considered Modularization instead of having the vehicle class 
    handle every litle situation.
