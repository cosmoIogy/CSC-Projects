Decoders 
-take a binary value and produce a single high line.

Number of outputs :
n to 2^n

Encoders
-take a high line and output the binary value that corresponds to that line

Multiplexers
-select an input to be the output

Demultiplexers
-have a single input line. the selectors choose where that input line goes (i.e. which output line)

RS FlipFlops

Clocked RS FlipFlops

CPU - Central Processing Unit

Instruction Cycle for CPU:
1. Fetch - gets the next instruction
2. Increment the program counter by pointing to the next instruction
3. Decode current instruction; identify OPerands and OP-code
4. Execute the instruction
5. Repeat
